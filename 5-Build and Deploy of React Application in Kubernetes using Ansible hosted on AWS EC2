Configuration to be used for this project:
Image: Ubuntu Server 24.04

Type: t3.micro

In case, you want to use same as Docker image, make project with t3.large . make sure you set remote configurations and ssh key connection if you are using t3.micro

the below project is setup in assumption of having both docker and ansible in single server and with type t3.large

#Note: AWS Free Tier is only for 750 Hours per year, so make sure you stop instance once you are done with the project


Before We start this Ansible, i recommend you to watch all the other series, as we are making changes to single react project from the start

We will use the same project here

Ansible is widely popular configuration management tool and can be installed in one server and you can run tasks in other servers if Ansible Master(server in which ansible is installed ) and other servers have SSH connection

Ansible files must be saved with .yaml or .yml extension

Before, We proceed on Ansible, let us move Bash scripts that we have written in Part-4 to Github repository


We will use this repository as a part of our project
We will install Ansible in our Build Server and then we will make an SSH  connection to our Deployserver from BuildServer

We will ask Ansible to run build.sh script in Buildserver and then deploy.sh in Deployserver

We will write a ansible playbook to achieve this, playbook is a set of tasks to be performed

let us now start with project by installing Ansible

login to Buildserver and install ansible by running these commands


sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible 
Copy



check ansible installation by command

ansible --version
Copy


ansible config file shows None, by default ansible creates config file.
##note: if config file does not show none for you , no need to create config file
###if config file shows none#######################################
let us create a default config file
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible
sudo touch /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts
Copy
We have created ansible directory in etc and and ansible.cfg file and hosts file inside ansible directory

Now lets edit the config file
sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Copy
Paste the contents
[defaults]
inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = /path/to/your/private/key
Copy
Now before we make changes to private key path, let us create a ssh-key file for ansible using command
ssh-keygen
Copy

copy the private key path that is shown in brackets of Enter file in which to save the key(),
if you have used the default
so now our ansible.cfg file is updated in this way
[defaults]
inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519
Copy
Now you can verify our ansible config file by ansible --version, it will show config file now
ansible --version
Copy


##########################################################################

Now when we created ssh-keygen as part of ansible config file creation, it generates two keys
private key and public key



recommend you to create key pair for ansible
copy the contents of public key


it cab be id_rsa and id_rsa.pub keys in your case, copy the contents of id_rsa.pub if so
Now login to your Deployserver and in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys, we will paste the
copied public key to establish connection
sudo vi /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
Copy

Note:You can paste the public key in any number of servers,you want to delegate your ansible tasks

When AWS EC2 is stopped and started again, its public Ip changes but private IP remains the same.

We will make use of this , copy Deployserver private IP address.

Come back to BuildServer and in /etc/ansible/hosts , we will update this server ip 

hosts file is a file in which we will update IP's or hostnames or servers in which we want to ansible to run

By default hosts file is /etc/ansible/hosts,
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
Copy


here in above screenshot [deployserver] means group, anything inside [] is considered group
and when we specify in ansible playbook hosts:deployserver, ansible executes tasks in all
the Ip's that are under the group

Now let us check ansible connection of hosts by command
ansible all -m ping
Copy

so we were able to make connection between build server and deploy server through ansible
since our ansible is in buildserver, let us write two playbook in BuildServer one playbook to build images and other playbook to deploy images
Build of React Application
Let us grab some examples on how to run bash scripts in ansible from ansible official documentation .since we have our ansible on the same server in which we are building docker images,we will write playbook to execute tasks on localhost
---
- name: Playbook to build our docker image
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:  
   - name: remove existing bashscripts directory and ignore task if bashscripts folder is not there
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo rm -r bashscripts
     ignore_errors: yes    
       
   - name: create new bashscripts directory
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo mkdir bashscripts         

   - name: clone bash scripts repo into server
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo git clone https://github.com/Hari0o/react-nginx_bashscripts.git
       chdir: bashscripts/

   - name: giving ownership to build.sh and giving excecuting permissions to build.sh
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo chown ubuntu build.sh && sudo chmod 744 build.sh
       chdir: bashscripts/react-nginx_bashscripts

   - name: running script to make build
     ansible.builtin.shell: 
       cmd: ./build.sh
       chdir: bashscripts/react-nginx_bashscripts/
Copy

Here in the top, we have asked in first step to remove directory bashscripts and we also added attribute ignore_errors:yes attribute to task-1, ansible executes tasks one by one. In case if task-1 fails, it will not proceed to task-2 and will kill playbook execution throwing error.In the above playbook, i have used only shell module, you can use different modules likewise one for git and many. you can find modules with examples in ansible docs

Now before running playbook you can check syntax of playbook with command
ansible-playbook build.yaml --syntax-check
Copy



Now lets run our playbook as we see no syntax error
ansible-playbook build.yaml
Copy


once playbook is completed, you can verify in our docker hub last push time of image


Our build is successful and pushed to Docker hub

Deploy of React Application
Now let us write another playbook in Buildserver to deploy kubernetes in our Deployserver
since Deployserver is a remote server, we made ssh connection and verified connectivity already

---
- name: Playbook to deploy our application in kubernetes
  hosts: deployserver
  tasks:  
   - name: remove existing bashscripts directory and ignore task if bashscripts folder is not there
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo rm -r bashscripts
     ignore_errors: yes    
       
   - name: create new bashscripts directory
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo mkdir bashscripts         

   - name: clone bash scripts repo into server
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo git clone https://github.com/Hari0o/react-nginx_bashscripts.git
       chdir: bashscripts/

   - name: giving ownership to build.sh and giving excecuting permissions to deploy.sh
     ansible.builtin.shell:
       cmd: sudo chown ubuntu deploy.sh && sudo chmod 744 deploy.sh
       chdir: bashscripts/react-nginx_bashscripts

   - name: running script to make build
     ansible.builtin.shell: 
       cmd: ./deploy.sh
       chdir: bashscripts/react-nginx_bashscripts/
Copy

In the above task-3 "&&" represents one command after other, it is linux command and in hosts , we mentioned deployserver, it is the group name that we added in /etc/ansible/hosts file and check syntax by
ansible-playbook deploy.yaml --syntax-check
Copy


Now let us run the playbook by command

ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
Copy




once playbook is done, verify pods restart time in Deployserver

kubectl get pods -n react-nginx
Copy


This shows our Deployment is successful

####To Add work with different hosts file##############################
In case, you want to work with different hosts file instead of default hosts file
create a host file with any name , let us create testhosts with dummy data

In this case, the command to be run as
ansible-playbook -i testhosts deploy.yaml
Copy
here in the above example testhosts refer to inventory
#################################################################
Domain visibility
Go for AWS EC2, security groups and In inbound rules allow port 80,as our nginx listens on port 80


post that copy AWS EC2 public IP,

Log into your GoDaddy Console and My Products >Domain > DNS.In A records, paste the AWS EC2 public IP

Now we will be able to access our domain in which we can see our React application that we have built and deployed

AWS public IP changes once the system is stopped and started back. to avoid this, we can use AWS Elastic IP with some cost charges
